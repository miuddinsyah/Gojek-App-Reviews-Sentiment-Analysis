# **Sentiment Analysis of Gojek App Reviews on Play Store**  

This project aims to analyze user sentiment towards the Gojek app based on reviews collected from the Google Play Store. The sentiment analysis is performed using multiple machine learning methods, including **K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Random Forest, Binary Classification, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**.  

## **Project Structure**  

This repository contains the following main files:  

- **`GojekAppReviewV4.0.0-V4.9.3_Cleaned.csv`**: The dataset containing cleaned user reviews, ready for analysis.  
- **`Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code to perform sentiment analysis using different machine learning methods.  
- **`Tugas BesarAzmi Taqiuddin Syah, Terryanda Naufaldo Arhaby, Raihanna Fawaz.pdf`**: A report document detailing the methodology, implementation, and results of the sentiment analysis.  

## **Requirements**  

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have installed the necessary Python libraries:  

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `tensorflow`  
- `nltk`  

You can install them using the following command:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow nltk
```

## **How to Use**  

1. **Prepare the Data**: Ensure the dataset file `GojekAppReviewV4.0.0-V4.9.3_Cleaned.csv` is available in your working directory.  
2. **Run the Analysis**: Open and execute the `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or a similar platform. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
3. **Review the Results**: For a detailed explanation of the methodology and analysis outcomes, refer to the report document `Tugas BesarAzmi Taqiuddin Syah, Terryanda Naufaldo Arhaby, Raihanna Fawaz.pdf`.
